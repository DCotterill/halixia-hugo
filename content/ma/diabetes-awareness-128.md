All you need to know about diabetes

Diabetes can be a lifelong condition that causes your blood sugar levels to become too high. There are two types of diabetes and you can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes with simple lifestyle changes.

One in ten people over 40 in the UK are now living with type 2 diabetes, thatâ€™s 3.8 million people. Almost a million more are living with the condition but don't know they have it. By 2030 it is predicted this number will rise to 5.5 million.
