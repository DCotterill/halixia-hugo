How taking out private medical insurance works

Private healthcare is paid-for medical treatment. It's an alternative to free treatment on the NHS. It can be costly, but taking out private medical insurance to pay for it can help.

Private medical insurance is designed to cover you for non-routine tests and treatment for acute conditions; typically those that are serious, curable and usually short-lived. It gives peace of mind that you can get treatment quickly and be back on your feet sooner.
