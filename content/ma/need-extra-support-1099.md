Learn about men's mental health support groups.

Seeking mental health support can save lives, improve mental health, and promote positive coping strategies. It can also reduce the risk of suicide.

Men have higher suicide rates than women. Social and cultural pressures as well as historic norms may make you hesitant to seek help, but support services provide a safe, confidential space for you to talk about your struggles. It can also help reduce stigma and provide access to mental health treatment.
