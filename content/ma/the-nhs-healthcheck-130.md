A health check-up for adults 40 to 74 in England

This 5-year check-up is aimed at adults in England aged 40 to 74. It's designed to detect early signs of stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.

After the check your healthcare professional will discuss your results with you. You'll be given advice to help you lower your risk of a stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes or dementia, and maintain or improve your health. But donâ€™t wait until then to make healthy changes!
