A health check-up for adults 40 to 74 in England

This check-up is for adults in England aged 40 to 74, every 5 years. It's designed to spot early signs of stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes or dementia.

After the check your healthcare professional will discuss your results with you. You'll be given advice to help you lower your risk of a stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes or dementia, and maintain or improve your health. But you do not have to wait until then to make healthy changes.
