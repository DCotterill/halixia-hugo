Eating nuts can help you live longer

Eating more nuts can help you live longer and have lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer. Eating a handful of nuts a day can go a long way in benefitting your health.

Eating nuts as part of a healthy diet may be good for the heart. Nuts contain unsaturated fatty acids and other nutrients. They are a great inexpensive snack food, easy to store and easy to pack when you're on the go.
