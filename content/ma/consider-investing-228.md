Investing can be a great way to get your money to grow

This simple checklist will help you decide whether you're ready to start your investment journey, when to invest and whether you have a few things still to tick off before exploring your options.

Investing in stocks & shares is a popular alternative to cash deposits. On average, stock markets consistently outperform most cash savings over longer periods (5+ years), but you can experience losses. However, if you plan your strategy carefully, you can keep the risk within acceptable levels for you.
