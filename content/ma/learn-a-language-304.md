Open up your world with aÂ short languages course

Discover a new language, explore different cultures or learn more about the power of communication. It could lead to a more formal qualification or a new career.

With increasing demand for language skills in education, and more broadly across the economy in client-facing roles, the ability to communicate in more than one language could be your ticket to a new career, or your passport to a new life abroad.
