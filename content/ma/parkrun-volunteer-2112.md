You don't have to run to get involved with the Parkrun

Offer your time and support to assist in organising and facilitating Parkruns, promoting community fitness and well-being.

Volunteering at Parkruns involves various roles, such as marshalling, timing, or supporting participants. It fosters community engagement, encourages physical activity, and contributes to the success and inclusivity of local fitness events.
