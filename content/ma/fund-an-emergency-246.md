An emergency fund is a step towards financial security

Building an emergency fund can help prevent you needing to borrow money or make difficult financial decisions, by giving you savings to fall back on. How much you need, will depend on your situation.

According to research up to a third of adults had no or less than £1,000 in savings. Regular saving provides good financial resilience, making you more likely to cope with loss of income, less anxious about finances, more confident in managing money and more satisfied with life as a whole.
