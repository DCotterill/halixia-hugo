A will is a legal document that lets you decide what happens to your money, property and possessions after your death. It can also let people know your funeral wishes and who will look after any dependent children. If you make a will you can also make sure you do not pay more Inheritance Tax than you need to.
You can write your will yourself, but you should get advice if your affairs are not straightforward.  This guide sets out the main reasons for writing a will and low cost options for people with simple affairs. 
If you die without leaving a will, the courts will decide who your assets will pass to and that might not be who you wish.


Research from insurer Canada Life in 2020 revealed three in five (59 per cent) of UK adults have not written a will.  This is equivalent to 31 million people, who run the risk of the law deciding who their assets are left to when they die.


There are many reasons for writing a will, including:
- You have dependent children
- You aren't married to your partner 
- You're worried about inheritance tax
- Your personal circumstances change
- You have specific funeral wishes
- You own property with someone else or overseas 

For your will to be legally valid, you must:
- Be 18 or over
- Make it voluntarily
- Be of sound mind
- Make it in writing
- Sign it in the presence of 2 witnesses who are both over 18
- Have it signed by your 2 witnesses, in your presence

### How to action
If your personal circumstances are simple or straightforward, there are a number of ways in which you can write a low cost will:

**Subsidised will writing service from solicitors** - Many charities offer fee-free will-writing by solicitors.
