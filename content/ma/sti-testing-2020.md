Learn about why you should get tested

Learn more about getting tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Anyone who is sexually active, regardless of age, or relationship status, should consider getting tested regularly.

Getting tested for sexual health is important for several reasons. It helps detect and treat sexually transmitted infections (STIs) early, prevents the spread of infections to partners, ensures reproductive health, provides peace of mind, and promotes overall well-being and responsible sexual behaviour. Regular testing is crucial, especially for sexually active individuals, to maintain good sexual health and make informed decisions regarding their sexual well-being.
