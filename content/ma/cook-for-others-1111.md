Learn about making meals for those in your community

Whether someone is sick, grieving or new to the area, try going to your charity shop and picking up a cheap casserole dish to make a meal for someone in your community.

Bringing meals to your neighbours can help build a stronger sense of community and promote goodwill. By showing kindness and empathy towards others, you could create a ripple effect of positive actions within your community.
