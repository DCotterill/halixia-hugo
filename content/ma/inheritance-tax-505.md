What reliefs and exemptions are there from inheritance tax?

Understand the implications of inheritance tax, what's exempt and where to get further advice.

Inheritance tax is payable on the value of your estate after you die, at 40% of the value over the tax-free allowance.  This allowance has been frozen since 2011, increasing the number of estates liable to inheritance tax.  However with careful planning itâ€™s possible to ensure more is passed onto your loved ones.
