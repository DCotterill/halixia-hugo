All you need to know about Diabetes

Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. There are 2 main types of diabetes and in the UK around 90% of adults with diabetes have type 2.

If you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly. 
There are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes. 
You can help manage type 2 diabetes through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight.
