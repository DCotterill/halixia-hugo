Send a card or letters to a family member.

Show your love and care by sending a heartfelt card or letter to a family member you haven't seen in a while, strengthening emotional connections despite the physical distance.

Sending a thoughtful card conveys love, gratitude, and a desire to stay connected. It bridges the gap between family members, maintaining a sense of closeness and reminding them of your affection.
