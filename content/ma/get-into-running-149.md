Couch to 5k, work up towards running 5km in just 9 weeks

Taking up running can seem like a scary prospect, but the NHS couch to 5K will help you gradually work up towards running 5km in just 9 weeks, through a guided mix of walking and running.

Running is a great way to improve your overall physical health. It can improve heart and lung health, increase joint strength and stability and improve your mental wellbeing. Running involves very little equipment other than a pair of good running shoes.
