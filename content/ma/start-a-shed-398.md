How to set up a Men's Shed as a safe place for men to meet.

Menâ€™s Sheds are a place to pursue practical interests, to practice skills and enjoy making and mending - whilst making social connections and friendship - set one up and help men in your community.

We are social beings, and interacting with people is in our nature. Helping others enjoy the mental and physical benefits of social connectiveness brings its own rewards instilling a strong sense of purpose, boosting our own wellbeing.
