Learn about the tax efficient savings accounts

Make sure you don’t pay more tax than you need to, with this guide to tax-free savings and investments for you and your children or grandchildren.

Since 2016, the personal savings allowance sets an amount of savings interest you can earn without paying tax on that interest. The amount of the allowance depends on much tax you pay, £1,000 in savings interest a year, for a basic rate taxpayer, and £500, for a higher rate taxpayer.
