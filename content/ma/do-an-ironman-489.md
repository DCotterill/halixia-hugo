The ultimate triathlon, are you ready to commit?

Sign up for an Ironman triathlon consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile marathon run. Not for the faint-hearted, it is the gold standard of endurance triathlon racing.

A regular combination of swimming, cycling, and running will help you lower your risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and depression. Triathletes have a lower heart rate, meaning, your heart doesnâ€™t have to work as hard. These health benefits will automatically add more years to your life.
