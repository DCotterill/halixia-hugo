Learn about the importance of looking after wildlife

Learn about the importance of looking after wildlife in your garden such as, biodiversity support, ecosystem health, natural pest control, pollination, and a deeper connection with nature.

The UK's wildlife is continuing to decline, with hundreds of species now at risk of disappearing from our shores altogether.  Since the 1970s urbanisation, agriculture, pollution and climate change have all caused the nation's plants and animals to dwindle. Making some small changes could make a big difference to our natural environment.
