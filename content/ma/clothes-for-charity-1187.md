Importance of donating clothes

Learn about why you should and how to donate old clothes for a more sustainable lifestyle - you might even pick up a second-hand bargain for yourself.

Donating your old clothes is important as it helps individuals and communities in need as well as promoting sustainability and reducing waste whilst also creating a meaningful way to give back, support others, and make a positive impact on the environment and society as a whole.
