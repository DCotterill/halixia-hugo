Find and join your local library, for many free services

Your local library provides many services such as book loans, CD rental and internet access. Some may offer reading events and 24-hour online services.

A public library is the biggest treasure known to local communities. It's always free to join and what you find there might surprise you and do more than inspire just a love of reading.
