Help and support to think differently about working longer

Think differently about working as you get older. Staying in work and taking control of when and how you retire can give you more money in later life as well as benefit your health and wellbeing.

Get ahead and keep working the way you want. Employers in the UK waste a huge amount of talent, skills and experience by denying older workers the chance to stay in jobs or find new ones. Many older workers face discrimination and challenges that, with a little support, could be overcome.
