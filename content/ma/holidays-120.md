Importance of taking holidays

Holidays are not just for relaxation; they help us deal with stressors and contribute to our overall wellbeing. Canâ€™t afford a holiday? You can also get the same effect with a day trip!

Taking holidays can be a great chance to escape your daily routine and see new places, whilst also improving your health or well-being.
