Learn about PTSD and how to help others

Learn about the importance of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) awareness to enhance your understanding of PTSD, its impact, and support those affected by it.

It’s estimated that 50% of people will experience a trauma at some point in their life, for the majority of people this short-term distress fades to a memory. However, around 20% of people go on to develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). That’s around 6,665,000 people in the UK, yet it is still an incredibly misunderstood and misdiagnosed condition.
