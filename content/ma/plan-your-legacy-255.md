Use an advisor who specialises in later life planning

The Society of Later Life Advisors is a not for profit organisation that matches clients with advisors who have been accredited to give advice on later life issues.

Financial wellbeing put simply is all about building a good relationship with money and feeling in control of both your day-to-day finances and long-term goals. This is also true when planning how you are going to pass your money to your loved ones.
