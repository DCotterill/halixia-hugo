Making freshly baked homemade bread is special

Making fresh bread at home is a satisfying and rewarding skill. From mixing and proving to shaping and baking, making delicious homemade loaves isn't easy to master without some help and guidance. 

Homemade bread is more nutritious and tastier than the store-bought variety as you can control what goes in it. Aside from the nutritional value, baking your own bread is good for your mental health. Mixing the ingredients, kneading the bread, and watching the dough rise can be soothing.
