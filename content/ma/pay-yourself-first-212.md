How to set aside money for savings before you pay expenses

Saving some money each month is important, even if it’s just a little. There is a psychological boost to seeing your savings or investments grow.

According to research up to a third of adults have none or less than £1,000 in savings. Regular saving provides good financial resilience, making you more likely to cope with loss of income, less anxious about finances, more confident in managing money and more satisfied with life as a whole.
