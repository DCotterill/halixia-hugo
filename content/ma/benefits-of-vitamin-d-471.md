The importance of vitamin D and the best way to get it

Vitamin D is known as” the sunshine vitamin” as it is the only nutrient our body can make from exposure to sunlight. Learn about the importance and benefits of vitamin D and how to add to your diet.

UK Government advice is that everyone should take a vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter months. Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. The need increases as we age to help against the risk of bone fragility.
