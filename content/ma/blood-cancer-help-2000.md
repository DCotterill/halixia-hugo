Help people with blood cancer through stem cell donation.

Register to be a stem cell donor and know that for someone with blood cancer or a blood disorder, a stem cell transplant from a matching donor could be their last chance of survival.

Today, blood cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, and the third biggest cancer killer. A lack of public awareness causes shortfall in lifesaving stem cell donors. Registering to donate stem cells is a great way to give the gift of a second chance to someone.
