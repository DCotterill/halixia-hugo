Learn about the importance of joining social groups

Joining a social group, such as the WI, is a great way to meet new people, learn new things, find support, get out of your comfort zone and pursue your passions.

We are social beings, and interacting with people is in our nature. But it also brings us benefits on a mental and physical level, social motivation and social contact. This can help to improve memory formation and recall and protects the brain from neurodegenerative diseases for a better longer life.
