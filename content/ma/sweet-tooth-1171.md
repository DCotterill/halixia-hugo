The occasional sweet treat is a great mood booster

Many of us have got a sweet tooth and we all know too much sugar isn't good for you, but a regular treat can be beneficial and satisfy cravings and allow us to indulge in a bit of self-care. 

Treating yourself can provide a small indulgence and moment of pleasure. It can boost mood, relieve stress, and satisfy cravings. However, moderation is key to prevent excessive sugar intake and prioritise a balanced diet for long-term health.
