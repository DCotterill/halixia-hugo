Ever thought about taking up sewing as hobby

Some of us were lucky enough to learn to sew at a young age, but picking up a new hobby as an adult doesn't have to be daunting. You'll gain a great life skill that's practical as well as therapeutic.

Learning to sew as a hobby allows for creative expression, develops practical skills, promotes mindfulness and relaxation, encourages resourcefulness and sustainability. As well as leading to cost savings and the satisfaction of creating unique items.
