Wills are important whether or not you have very much

Most people who are married, have dependants or have any assets would likely benefit from making a will, to ensure your assets are passed on as you wish.

Research from insurer Canada Life in 2020 revealed three in five of UK adults have not written a will. This is equivalent to 31 million people, who run the risk of the law deciding who their assets are left to when they die.
