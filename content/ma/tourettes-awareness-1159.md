Raise your awareness of Tourette Syndrome (TS)

If you know someone with TS it may be worthwhile learning about it, its challenges, and the experiences of individuals living with it.

It is estimated that Tourette Syndrome (TS) affects one school child in every hundred and more than 300,000 children and adults in the UK live with the condition. Improving awareness helps to foster understanding, acceptance, and support for individuals affected by TS to help reduce stigma and promote a more inclusive society.
