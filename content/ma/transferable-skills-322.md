The importance of transferable skills

You are already likely to possess many transferable skills employers value. Highlighting your transferable skills is especially important when changing jobs or industries.

Many job seekers canâ€™t capture their transferable skills adequately, communicate them well or even identify how their skills can apply across industries. If you are seeking a career change, transferable skills can be the factor that most impacts your ability to find work in a new field.
