Cook for your younger family members

There's mountains of research about the social emotional and intellectual benefits of the family dinner, so cook a few extra spuds and invite the grandchildren round.

By eating meals together we practice gratitude. While sharing and enjoying a tasty meal with those who are the closest to you, you feel happy and more content as well as help to foster a sense of security and belonging, and even alleviate depression.
