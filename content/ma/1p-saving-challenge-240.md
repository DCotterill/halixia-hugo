Everyone can start an emergency fund.

Here’s everything you need to know to make a start on saving for a rainy day, even if you are on limited income.

According to research up to a third of adults have none or less than £1,000 in savings. Regular saving provides good financial resilience, making you more likely to cope with loss of income, less anxious about finances, more confident in managing money and more satisfied with life as a whole.
