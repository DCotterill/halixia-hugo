Connect with dog owners and borrow their dog for walks

BorrowMyDoggy connects people who don't own a dog with dog owners to help look after their dog, for walks, weekend, and holidays.

Spending time with a dog can greatly improve your mood, thereby helping you to have a more positive perspective. This can help create healthier relationships, improved productivity, and a significant improvement in your overall well-being as well as reducing stress.
