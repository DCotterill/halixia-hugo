Read about the benefits of yoga for the over 50s

Read about how starting yoga later in life does require adjustments and the practice itself changes as we age, for the better! Yoga after 50 is a time for moving inward, and that’s a positive thing.

Yoga is for everyone, whatever ability or disability, age, experience,  fitness or bendiness and you can do it anywhere and anytime. Finding a yoga practice that’s right for you is worth the effort as it helps deepen the neural grooves that help us enjoy the benefits that regular practice brings.
