Guide to managing money during periods of ill health

If you’re facing a health problem, try and sort out your money situation as soon as you can. This guide covers benefits entitlement, local council support, and where to get help with everyday costs like prescriptions, electricity and gas.

You can still build good money habits even if you’ve experienced a reduction in income. Good financial resilience makes you more likely to cope with loss of income, less anxious about finances, more confident in managing money and more satisfied with life as a whole.
