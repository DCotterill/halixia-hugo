Learn about the benefits of gardening with children

Children love growing plants and love being involved in the garden but theyâ€™re often impatient for instant results. Try to capture their enthusiasm with simple quick projects everyone can enjoy. 

Gardening with children promotes physical activity, exposes them to nature, teaches responsibility and patience, encourages healthy eating habits, enhances sensory development, fosters a connection with the environment, and cultivates a sense of accomplishment and appreciation for nature's cycles.
